    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
<li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
<li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
<li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="one">Gather all the ingredients</li>
        <p></p>
        <li class="two">Grind garlic and pinch of salt together in a mortar and pestle until smooth; add parsley and mix well. Pound butter into garlic mixture with the pestle until well combined. Wrap butter mixture in plastic wrap; refrigerate until cold, at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li class="three">Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Place 1/4 of the butter mixture in the center of the wider end of each chicken breast</li>
        <p></p>
        <li class="four">Fold the narrower end of each chicken breast up over the butter to form a tight pocket around the butter; gather the sides of each chicken breast to the center to form a round ball. The top of each chicken ball will be smooth and the bottom will be gathered. Tightly wrap each chicken ball in plastic wrap; transfer to a plate and chill in the freezer until the gathered bottoms hold together and are slightly firm, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li class="five">Whisk flour and 2 teaspoons salt together in a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs together in another shallow bowl. Pour panko bread crumbs into a third bowl.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li class="six">Remove chicken breast balls from plastic wrap. Gently press them into the flour mixture to coat; shake off any excess flour. Dip into beaten eggs, then press into bread crumbs. Place breaded chicken on a plate; cover with plastic wrap, and return to the freezer to chill until firm, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li class="seven">Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Working in batches, place chicken, gathered-side down, in the hot oil and cook until lightly golden, about 1 minute per side. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking sheet; sprinkle salt and cayenne pepper over the top.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li class="eight">Bake in the preheated oven until you can hear the butter start to sizzle on the baking sheet, 15 to 17 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <p></p>
        <li class="nine">Let rest for a few minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
